# Galakei: Japanese feature phone support

Japanese feature phones (a.k.a., keitai, galakei) have a number of restrictions over normal web browsers.  This library adds support for them.

### Goals

 * Provide support for 3G handsets from the major 3 carriers in Japan (docomo, au, SoftBank)
 * Avoid modifying Rails internals as much as possible
